# Music Player Using Data Structures

## Project Overview

 It is a C++ based Basic Music Player that demonstrates the application of various data structures. The key data structures used in this project include:
 **Doubly Linked List**: To manage the playlist of songs.
 **Stacks**: To keep track of the history of played songs (implementing the "previous" functionality).
 **Queues**: To manage the upcoming songs (implementing the "next" functionality).

File handling is employed to read from and write to song files.

## Key Functionalities

1. **Add Song**
    Add new songs to the playlist.

2. **Remove Song**
   Remove existing songs from the playlist.

3. **Play Song**
    Play a song from the playlist.

4. **Next Song**
    Move to the next song in the queue.

5. **Previous Song**
    Go back to the previous song using the stack.

6. **Display Playlist**
    Show the current list of songs in the playlist.

7. **Save Playlist**
    Save the current playlist to a file.

8. **Load Playlist**
    Load a playlist from a file.

## Data Structures Utilized

### 1. **Doubly Linked List**
    Used for maintaining the playlist, allowing efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal in both directions.

### 2. **Stacks**
    Used to store the history of played songs, enabling the user to go back to previously played songs.

### 3. **Queues**
    Used to manage the upcoming songs, allowing the user to skip to the next song in the list.

## File Handling
**Read Songs**: Load songs from a file into the playlist.
**Write Songs**: Save the current playlist to a file for future use.

By combining these data structures and functionalities, this project aims to create a functional clone of song playlists used in applications.
